#### Description:

- Hi :wave: ! This project provides a place in the web to setup tasks to help get organized and keep track of daily tasks, goals and schedule by log in with an account, creating, editing and deleting tasks when needed.

- I used Javascript in the Backend in this project because it's the language I am most familiarized with, right now. This application uses the [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) framework to creating the server and managing routes, and [express-session](https://github.com/expressjs/session#readme) module for session management. The templating of pages uses [EJS](https://ejs.co/). For storing user and session data I decided to use sqlite3.
